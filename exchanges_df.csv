performance of the Elrond architecture, to offer global, near-instant, inexpensive transactions among an expanding suite of assets.

The essence of current versions of automated market makers is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k

Based on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k.

But current AMM performance could be significantly improved by rebuilding them on 
vastly more scalable architectures.

By reimagining an automated market maker on top of a highly scalable architecture that is high bandwidth, low latency, and inexpensive, the performance of the swap processes can be drastically improved. With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to new mark";https://maiar.exchange/;https://assets.coingecko.com/markets/images/741/small/maiar-dex.png?1638433160;0.0;7;83;202.05706565234584;202.05706565234584
